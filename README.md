# screen-object 
screen-object is a ruby gem. It is a wrapper on top of Appium. This gem helps create screen objects for automating ios and android mobile apps. screen-object methods interact with the elements on the screen. 

### Software Requirements 
This gem is tested on Ruby 2.1.3, Ruby 2.1.5 and Ruby 2.3.0

### Gem Dependencies
Other gems used by screen-object 

1. rake
2. require_all
3. rspec
4. cucumber
5. appium_lib
6. page_navigation
7. childprocess

### Setup Instructions

Add the gem to gemfile
  
````ruby
gem 'screen-object'
````

Add the gem to supporting file

````ruby
require 'screen-object'
````
 
Include screen-object module to the class
 
 ````ruby
include ScreenObject
````

After including this screen-object module, numerous methods will be added in to your class that allow you to define your screen. For the login page you might design your test in following way:

Calling the text_field and button methods. To login, we could simply write the following code:


````ruby
class LoginScreen

    include screen-object
    # This will add several methods to our page object that allow us to interact with the items on the screen.

        text_field(:username, "name~username”)
        text_field(:password, "name~password”)
        button(:login, "name~login”)

        def enter_username(username)
            self.username = username
        end

        def enter_password(password)
            self. password = password
        end

        def click_login_button
            login
        end

    end
````

Now , you can call those methods into actual step_definition file

````ruby
    on(LoginScreen).enter_username(“testuser”)
    on(LoginScreen).enter_password(“secrect”)
    on(LoginScreen).click_login_button
````

### RoadMap
1. Add collection methods
2. Wiki documentation page
3. Add device specific methods to the accessors
4. Make the gem tool agnostic and support other tools based on demand
